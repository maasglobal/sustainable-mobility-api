# Sustainable Mobility API server
This project provides an example server for the Sustainable Mobility API project.

## Running the server
In order to run the server, you will need a few dependencies:

- Python 3.7
- pipenv

### Install project dependencies
You can install the project dependencies with the following command from within the `api` directory:

```sh
pipenv install
```

### Launch the virtual environment
Once pipenv has installed the dependencies, you can launch the virtual environment with this command:

```sh
pipenv shell
```

### Run the server
Once the virtual environment is active and dependencies are installed, you can run the example server by running the following command:

```sh
python api.py
```

### Accessing the documentation UI

Once the server is running, you can access the documentation UI to try it out:

> http://127.0.0.1:8080/ui/

### Try the API from command line

```bash
curl "http://localhost:8080/estimate-co2?transport_mode=small_car&distance_km=1"
{
  "co2_estimate": 112.0,
  "distance_km": 1.0,
  "transport_mode": "SMALL_CAR",
  "vehicle_occupancy": 1.5
}
```

### Deploy with Docker

You don't need to install Python if you have a docker environment available.
Use docker-compose to bring the docker container with API and documentation ready to be used:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Deploy the serverless function

You can use serverless framework to deploy estimate-co2 API to the AWS Lambda environment. Please note that it does not deploy Swagger UI with documentation, only an API endpoint.

To deploy CloudFormation stack with function available publically via HTTPs, issue following commands:

```bash
npm i -g serverless
npm install
serverless deploy
```

This will generate output which contains dynamic endpoint url for your function:

```bash

      "vehicle_occupancy" : 2,
      "co2_estimate" : 10356,
      "transport_mode" : "BUS"
   }
}
```

Invoke function locally:

```bash
pipenv run serverless invoke local -f post -d '{ "queryStringParameters": { "transport_mode": "small_car", "distance_km": 55 } }'
```
